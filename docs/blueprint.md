## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7AB4E8) to convey trust and reliability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to ensure a clean and airy feel.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#9370DB) for interactive elements to guide the user through the purchase flow.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for body text that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif, similar to Didot with geometric, high contrast thin-thick lines, with an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel. Pairing 'Playfair' for headings and 'PT Sans' will make the headings stand out and pair nicely with body text.
